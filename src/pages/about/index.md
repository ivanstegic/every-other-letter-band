### Shade-grown coffee

You're listening to “The TEN7 Podcast”, where we get together every fortnight, and sometimes more often, to talk about technology, business and the humans in it.

### **I'm your host Ivan Stegic.**

My guest today is Ernesto Morales, the founder and creative director of Studio Malagón, a graphic design agency that creates moments of connection in Austin, Texas. Ernesto leads a creative team that we are currently collaborating with on the new TEN7 site.



### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
